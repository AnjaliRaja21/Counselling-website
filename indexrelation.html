<h1 id="name"><b>What Is Love?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Love is an emotion that is often described as a feeling of strong affection. It is a feeling of strong attachment or admiration and cares for someone or something. It is often described as a warm, fuzzy feeling in the chest.
<br><br>
  Love is often associated with romance, but it can also be felt for friends, family, pets, and even things like favorite foods. Love is a very personal feeling and everyone experiences it differently.
  <br><br>
  There are many different types of love, such as parental love, friendship love, and romantic love. Each type of love has its unique characteristics.
  <br><br>
<b>  Parental love </b> is selfless and protective. Parents are often willing to do anything for their children, and they feel a strong sense of responsibility toward them. They want their children to be safe and secure and will go to great lengths to achieve that. Parental love is demonstrated when a parent sacrifices their time and resources for their child. For example, a parent may work overtime to pay tuition for their child.
  <br><br>
<b>  Friendship love </b> is supportive and nurturing. Friends are there for each other when things get tough, and they provide comfort and support to each other. They want the other to succeed and do whatever they can to help. For example, a friend may comfort another friend who is going through a difficult time.
  <br><br>
<b>  Romantic love </b> is passionate and intense. People in romantic relationships are strongly attracted to each other physically and experience strong feelings of passion, joy, and happiness. They want to be together all the time and enjoy doing things together. For example, they may have a strong desire to be near each other and feel butterflies in their stomach when they see each other.
  <br><br>
  Love is a very powerful emotion and can be both positive and negative. When love is positive, it may make people happy and content. When love is negative, it may cause people to feel angry, jealous, or possessive. Love is an important part of our lives and maybe a source of comfort, happiness, and security.</p>



<br><br>
<h1 id="name"><b>What Is a Relationship?</b></h1>
<p id="para">A relationship can be defined as a <b> mutual connection </b> between two or more people. It’s usually characterized by some degree of interdependence, which can be emotional, physical, financial, or a combination of these. The nature of a relationship can vary greatly depending on the people involved and the type of connection that exists between them.
<br><br>
  Some relationships are casual and involve little to more than occasional interactions or contact. Others are more serious and involve a deep emotional connection, mutual support, and regular communication. Whatever the case, relationships require time and effort to maintain and grow. If not nurtured, they may fade or even end altogether.
  <br><br>
  So what makes a strong relationship? There is no universal answer to this question, as it varies from couple to couple. However, among the most important factors are trust, respect, communication, honesty, and compatibility. If all of these things are present, a relationship is likely to be healthy and fulfilling for both partners.</p>


<br><br>
  <h1 id="name"><b>What Is the Difference Between Love and Relationship?</b></h1>
  <p id="para">The difference between love and a relationship can be summed up in one word: <b> commitment. </b> Love is an emotion that can be felt by anyone, while a relationship is a bond between two people that requires commitment.
<br><br>
    When you’re in love with someone, you may feel like you would do anything for them, but that doesn’t mean you’re automatically in a relationship with them. To be in a relationship, you must be willing to commit to the other person and do the work necessary to make the relationship work.
    <br><br>
    Love is often confused with infatuation or lust, but they aren’t the same thing. Infatuation means you are attracted to a person’s looks or personality, while lust means you are only interested in sex. Love is much more than that; it is an emotion that comes from the heart and involves feelings of caring, affection, and intimacy.
    <br><br>
    A relationship requires work from both sides for it to be successful. You must be willing to compromise and put your partner’s needs above your own. This isn’t always easy, but it’s worth it if you want to have a strong, healthy relationship.</p>





<br><br><br>
<h1 id="name"><b>When do relationships start to have common relationship problems?</b></h1>
<p id="para"> For some, however, that phase of love eventually fades. As time passes and both parties of the relationship make their fair share of mistakes, what was once intoxicating becomes intolerable.
<br><br>
  Much of the common relationship issues that couples face are minor and can easily be avoided with mutual effort, understanding and respect. Although bumps along the path of marriage are unavoidable, if you are aware of them beforehand, you will be able to overcome them without leading your relationship to the verge of collapse.
  <br><br>
  None of us are perfect, nor will we exactly be the same on every level.
  <br><br>
  Some character flaws, on the other hand, will be natural and acceptable. But if there are behaviors, perhaps a little lie here or an indiscretion there, it’s essential to consider that on a grander scale as the relationship progresses.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="name">Relationship problems and solutions</h1>
<p id="para">Common relationship issues are not hard to solve; all you need for that is a strong will to work on your relationship issues, and love, of course.
<br><br>
  Here are some common problems and the solutions for how to resolve your relationship problems that you should know about.
  <br><br>
  When wondering about how to solve relationship problems, it can be useful to read first and then bring the conversation up about how to handle relationship problems with your partner.</p>
<br><br>


  <h1 id="name"><b>1. Lack of trust</b></h1>
  <p id="para">Lack of trust is a major problem in any relationship.
<br><br>
  <b>Lack of trust isn’t always related to infidelity –</b> it can rear its head any time. If you find yourself constantly doubting your partner or wondering if they’re truthful with you, it’s time to tackle your trust issues together.
    <br><br>
    Relationship problems will keep mushrooming when there is a dearth of trust in a relationship.
    <br><br>
  <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Be consistent and trustworthy. Each of you should make an effort to be where you say you’re going to be and do what you say you’re going to do. This is one of the best solutions to marriage problems.
    <br><br>
    Call when you say you’ll call. Never lie to your partner. Showing empathy and respect for your partner’s feelings also helps to build trust.</p></p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>2. Overwhelm</b></h1>
  <p id="para">When life gets too much, you get overwhelmed. Maybe you’re in the midst of going after a promotion at work. Maybe they’re dealing with a troubled teenage son or daughter.
<br><br>
    Whatever the reason, your relationship soon takes a back seat. Then relationship problems keep building up.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
  <b>  Talk to each other about what’s happening, and about what kind of support each of you needs. </b> Lean on each other instead of getting so caught up in other issues that they drive a wedge between you. 
<br><br>
    Figure out together a time that will be just for you two.
   </p></p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>3. Poor communication</b></h1>
  <p id="para"> Poor communication leads to misunderstandings, fights, and frustration. It also leads to one or both of you feeling unheard and invalidated and can quickly build into resentment and other common relationship issues.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Communication is a skill like any other, and learning it can make all the difference to your relationship. Learn how to listen without judging or interrupting, and how to get your point across without attacking.
<br><br>
    Communicate with each other as friends, not combatants. <b> Figure out what your communication style is and how compatible it is with your partner.</b>
    <br><br>
    Work your way towards the solution by understanding what communication style would work better for both of you.
   </p></p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>4. Not prioritizing each other</b></h1>
  <p id="para"><b> It’s so easy to take your partner for granted, </b> especially when you have a lot of things going on. Before you know it, the only time you get together is over a hurried family dinner or while trying to get out the door in the morning.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Make time for each other every single day. No matter how busy you are, carve out fifteen or thirty minutes; that’s just for the two of you to talk and spend quiet time together.
<br><br>
    Text regularly throughout the day. Add in a weekly date night to make sure your partner knows they’re your priority.
   </p></p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>5. Money stress</b></h1>
  <p id="para"><b> Money is a leading cause of stress in relationships.</b> Maybe there’s not enough. Or maybe there is enough, but they spend it while you prefer to save. Perhaps you feel they’re too tight with the purse strings.
    <br><br>
    Whatever the issue, money can quickly cause problems.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    One of the tips to fix old relationship issues regarding finances is to put those good communication skills to work here and have a serious talk about money. Figure out a budget that you both agree on and stick to it.
<br><br>
 <b> Work out a financial plan for your future and take steps towards it together.</b> Make crystal clear agreements and keep them
   </p></p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>6. Changing priorities</b></h1>
  <p id="para">We all change as we move through life. Maybe you were both ambitious once, but now you’d rather live a quiet life. Perhaps your partner is no longer enthusiastic about your shared dream of buying a house by the sea.
<br><br>
    Changing priorities can cause a lot of conflicts.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Look for what you both still have in common while allowing your partner to change and grow. Embrace who they are now instead of pining for the past.
<br><br>
If you have different priorities about major lifestyle issues, <b> look for common ground, and compromise that you are both happy with. </b>
   </p></p>
<br><br><br><br>



<div align="center">

</div>

<br>
<h1 id="name"><b>7. Chore wars</b></h1>
  <p id="para">It’s easy to lose your temper when it feels like you’re the one taking out the trash for the hundredth time in a row, or you get home from overtime to find the house is a tip. Chore wars are a leading cause of conflict in relationships.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
  <b>  Agree together on who is responsible for what, and stick to it—factor </b> in a little flexibility for when one of you is much busier than usual.
<br><br>
If you both have different ideas of what constitutes a neat home, it might be time for a little compromise.
   </p></p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>8. Different intimacy needs</b></h1>
  <p id="para">Problems with your sex life are stressful and can have a big impact on your relationship. If one of you isn’t happy or you’re finding you have widely different intimacy needs, it’s time for a serious talk.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
  <b>  Carve out time for intimacy. </b> Arrange for someone else to take the kids once a week, or make the most of any time you have alone at home together.
<br><br>
    Sex keeps you feeling physically and emotionally close, so make sure you are both happy with your sex life.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>9. Lack of appreciation</b></h1>
  <p id="para">It doesn’t come as a surprise to you that bad bosses compel good workers to quit? Up to 75% quit their job not because of the position itself, but because of their boss who never expressed appreciation.
<br><br>
    Being taken for granted is one of the fundamental reasons for breakups.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
  <b>  Appreciation is what keeps us motivated and committed, </b> both in our work and our relationships.
<br><br>
    Remembering to compliment or notice the things our partner shows, we are grateful and increases the overall satisfaction with the relationship. Saying thank you goes a long way.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>10. Children</b></h1>
  <p id="para">Having kids is a blessing, but it requires a lot of dedication and effort. This can cause a strain on the relationship when partners disagree on the way they want to raise children, address problems that occur, and spend family time
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Talk to your partner about why they think something should be done differently and share your reasoning. Often, we are repeating or trying to avoid patterns we were raised by.
<br><br>
    Get together and spend some time understanding where the need to do things a certain way is coming from. When you understand, you can change and create a new way to parent that works for your family.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>11. Overinvolvement</b></h1>
  <p id="para">When we find the person, we love we want to share everything with them and to have them do the same. However, this can lead to feelings of losing one’s individuality, feeling of freedom, and a sense of accomplishment.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    What does it take for you to be your own person while being their partner? Think of areas that you want to keep to yourself that give you a feeling of achievement and freedom.
<br><br>
It might be a hobby or doing sports. Talk to your partner so they don’t feel rejected by this new change and introduce it gradually.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>12. Infidelity</b></h1>
  <p id="para">What each of us defines as infidelity and where we draw the line can differ. Infidelity means various things to different people. Infidelity can encompass, besides the sexual act, flirting, sexting or kissing.
<br><br>
 <b>   When infidelity has occurred, trust is broken, and a person can feel betrayed.</b> This can snowball into many other issues and problems.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Talking about what infidelity is for you and your partner is important. They may hurt you inadvertently because, for example, they don’t find flirting a problem.
<br><br>
When something has already occurred, there is a choice to be made. A couple can try to regain trust and rebuild or end the relationship. In case the first one is chosen, seeking professional help can be a wise decision.
<br><br>
Figuring out marriage challenges and solutions and learning how to work out relationship problems is much more productive with counseling.
   </p></p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>13. Significant differences</b></h1>
  <p id="para">When there is a critical difference in core values, the way partners approach life, and challenges, issues are bound to happen.
<br><br>
    For example, it might be that they are more spontaneous or hedonistic, while you plan more and save rather than spend. Nonetheless, if your views and expectations from life differ considerably, you are bound to argue.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    When there are core dissimilarities between you, you might wonder if you are suited for each other. The answer is – it depends. What kind of change would you both need to undertake for this relationship to survive?
<br><br>
Are you willing you make that change, and how much will it “cost” you? If you decide you can and want to change, by all means, give it a go. This is the only way you will know if the change is enough for this relationship to succeed.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>14. Jealousy</b></h1>
  <p id="para">You might be in a happy relationship for a long time before noticing the first signs of jealousy. They might act fine at first but slowly change.
<br><br>
    They start asking for your whereabouts, distrusting you, checking up on you, distancing or stifling you, and demonstrating concern about your affection towards them.
    <br><br>
 <b>   Often this behavior is a reflection of previous experiences </b> that were triggered by something that happened in the current relationship.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Both partners need to make an effort. If your partner is jealous, try to be transparent, predictable, honest, and share. Give them time to get to know you and trust you.
<br><br>
    However, for this to be solved, they need to make a separate effort to change their anticipations and work out their concerns. There is a difference between privacy and secrecy, and this line needs to be redrawn.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>15. Unrealistic expectations</b></h1>
  <p id="para">If you are human, you have unrealistic expectations; no one is free of them. Nowadays, we might expect our partner to play many major roles: the best friend, trusted companion, business partner, lover, etc.
<br><br>
    We might expect our partner to know what we want without saying it, advocate fairness at all times, or strive to change the other into what you desire them to be.
    <br><br>
    This can lead to misunderstandings, repeated quarrels, and misfortune.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
  <b>  If you want to solve a problem, you need to comprehend it first. </b> Ask yourself – what is it that you feel entitled to? If you could wave a magic wand and change things, how would the new, pink reality look like?
<br><br>
    What are you doing at the moment that you feel could get you there?
    <br><br>
    When you grasp what you are expecting to happen, but reality and your partner are depriving you of it, you can start to look for ways to ask differently or ask for different wishes.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>16. Growing apart</b></h1>
  <p id="para">So many things on the task list, and there is only one of you. How long ago did you stop including things to do with your partner on that list? Drifting apart happens bit by bit, and we don’t notice.
<br><br>
    You might wake up one morning and realize you can’t remember the last time you had sex, a date, or a conversation that is more than organizational.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
 <b>   A relationship is like a flower, and it can not blossom without nourishment.</b> When you notice the signs, it is time to act. It will take time to cross the distance that has been created, but it is possible.
<br><br>
    Prioritize your time together, bring back old habits and activities you did together, laugh, and take time to reconnect.
   </p></p>
<br><br>




<h1 id="name"><b>17. Lack of support</b></h1>
  <p id="para">When life hits us hard, we cope with it the best we know. However, often our coping skills are not enough, and we need support. Lack of support from a partner can lead to feelings of loneliness, anxiety, and feeling overwhelmed.
<br><br>
    Long-lasting lack of support also affects the way we value the relationship we are in, and satisfaction drops significantly.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    If you don’t ask, the answer is certainly “no.” Talking about what we need and what we can provide can clear the air of unrealistic expectations.
<br><br>
  <b>  Unspoken and unfulfilled needs lead to negative beliefs about the relationship. </b>
    <br><br>
    Understanding what our partner can provide helps adjust what we come to them for and look for alternative sources of support while our partner works on becoming one of the main pillars of encouragement and comfort again.
   </p></p>
<br><br>




<h1 id="name"><b>18. Addiction</b></h1>
  <p id="para"><b> Substance addiction can put a serious strain on a relationship. </b>
<br><br>
    Partner’s addiction can cause a significant effect on the family budget, cause many arguments, increase trust issues, cause ignorance and neglect of children and other family members, and impair overall relationship happiness.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Couple problems can be worked out with couples therapy. Counseling can be enormously helpful as it helps both partners deal with the issues arising simultaneously.
<br><br>
Understanding what triggers prompt addiction and building new habits as a couple promotes healthier ways of addressing problems. Individual therapy is recommended as well for both partners.
<br><br>
It can help understand the roots and patterns leading to addiction, and provide support to the non-addicted partner.
   </p></p>

  <br>
  <h1 id="name"><b>19. Moving at different speeds</b></h1>
    <p id="para">Do you find yourself in a current relationship uncomfortable with the speed the relationship is progressing?
<br><br>
      You might find your new partner moving more rapidly, wanting to spend more time together, constantly calling or texting, wanting to go away together, or you meeting their family?
      <br><br>
      Alternatively, you could be in a relationship that is not progressing the way you hoped it would, and the milestones you desired are not being reached.
      <br><br>
      When you and your partner need different speeds and intensities of intimacy and commitment, you may argue.
      <br><br>
      This can lead to becoming terribly upset over seemingly little things, pulling away, and questioning whether this person is for you.
    <br><br>
      <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
      <br><br>
      Don’t <b> sweep things under the rug rather address what is happening. </b> Avoiding problems is not the best relationship solution.
<br><br>
      What kind of reassurance or demonstration of love would bring you back on the same level? How are your needs different, and what can each of you do to find the middle ground?
     </p></p>
  <br><br>




  <h1 id="name"><b>20. Lack of responsibility</b></h1>
  <p id="para">When one of the partners avoids taking responsibility, it can cause severe damage to the partnership. Money struggles, child neglect, fighting over chores, or playing the blame game can happen daily.
<br><br>
    One of the most detrimental factors to the relationship is a significantly uneven distribution of responsibility amongst partners.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    When addressing this issue, the first thing to do is to stop the blaming game. If change is to occur, you need to look forward, not backward. If the change is to be long-lasting, it needs to happen gradually.
<br><br>
    Overwhelming a partner to make up for all this time of dodging responsibilities will just prove they were right to steer clear of them.
    <br><br>
    Give forgiving a shot as it has been linked to relationship success. Also, agree on the pace of change and the first things to share accountability for.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>21. Controlling behavior</b></h1>
  <p id="para">Controlling behavior happens when one of the partners expects the other to behave in certain ways, even at the expense of the wellbeing of the other partner.
<br><br>
    This kind of toxic behavior deprives the other partner’s freedom, confidence, and a sense of self-worth.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Controlling behavior is a learned pattern of behavior from primary family or previous relationships.
<br><br>
    At one point in life, this was beneficial for the controlling partner, and they need to learn to express affection differently. Speak up, set boundaries and adhere to them, and, if possible, try couples counseling.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>22. Boredom</b></h1>
  <p id="para"><b> All relationships undergo periods of fun and boredom.</b> However, when the feeling of monotony and apathy color, most of the days, it is time to react.
<br><br>
    Allowing to fall into a daily routine and go with the flow can lead to decreased libido and overall satisfaction with the relationship.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Think back to the honeymoon phase and recall the things you did as a newly formed couple. What is available from that list today, and what do you still feel you could enjoy?
<br><br>
Make a conscious decision to add spontaneity into the relationship to start the upward spiral to a more eventful relationship.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>23. Outside Influences</b></h1>
  <p id="para"><b> All couples are exposed to outside influences and opinions on how things should be done.</b>
<br><br>
    Some influences are benign, like grandparents’ occasional babysitting, while others can be detrimental, like disapproval of one spouse by the family or friends of the other.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Your relationship comes first, and everyone else’s opinion is secondary. Show each other support and that you are a united front against the world.
<br><br>
To resist the influence, you can limit the amount of time spent with or personal information you share with the family members or friends trying to impact you.
<br><br>
Marital problems and solutions may appear quite similar on the outside, but no one knows better than you what you need to make it work.

<h1 id="name"><b>24. Ineffective argument</b></h1>
  <p id="para">Arguments are a part of every relationship. However, the way fights are led, and what is their outcome can have a big impact on the relationship.
<br><br>
    Disagreement can be helpful or destructive, depending on what you do with them. Having the same fight over and over, losing your temper, or saying things you regret later is bound to make you feel it’s not worth it.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    After an argument, you should feel you have made progress in understanding where your partner is coming from.
<br><br>
    A good fight is one after which you have agreed on what can be the first step both will take to resolve the issue. Start by listening to hear the other side, not only by waiting for your turn.
    <br><br>
   <b> Research together ways to fight better and only ever focus on the next step needed to take. </b>

<h1 id="name"><b>25. Keeping a scoreboard</b></h1>
  <p id="para">When you keep blaming and recalling mistakes each of you has made, you are keeping a virtual scoreboard of each other’s faults. If being right is more important than being with the other person, the relationship is doomed.
<br><br>
    This leads up to a build-up of guilt, anger, and bitterness and doesn’t solve any problems.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Deal with each problem separately unless they are legitimately connected. Focus on the problem at hand and speak your mind. Don’t let it build up and mention it months later.
<br><br>
    Decide if you want to save the relationship and if you do, learn to accept the past as is and start focusing on where to go from here.

<h1 id="name"><b>26. Life gets in the way</b></h1>
  <p id="para">In a relationship, it’s usually the priority to nurture and develop the connection. When life is a persistent inconvenience, it means one or both of you were not necessarily ready to get involved, and that can happen. 
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    Unexpected encounters with another person occur all the time. But when they do, it’s essential to allow it to flourish- placing it first over the chaos.
<br><br>
When the two of you notice you put the union on the back burner, it’s time to make a conscious effort with reprioritizing the other person regardless of your day-to-day situation to battle the new relationship struggles.
   </p></p>
<br><br>




<h1 id="name"><b>27. Trust is critical from the very beginning</b></h1>
  <p id="para">Every relationship has problems, but when you first connect, you don’t want to go in with the idea that you can’t trust the other person. If this is baggage from a past relationship, that’s unfair and self-defeating for any new partnership. 
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    If your new partner made a promise and then lied to get out of it, that will create mistrust early on. That’s tough to get back. In an effort to do so, one piece of advice on relationship problems is that there needs to be much transparency and commitment in keeping your word moving forward.

<h1 id="name"><b>28. You can readjust goals at a moment’s notice</b></h1>
  <p id="para">Perhaps in the first few weeks of dating, your life goals appear to be similar, but a profound life circumstance changes your perspective on where you see yourself in the future or maybe your mate’s.
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    The change is not in keeping with what the two of you discussed. In this situation, you can find a way to get your partner to see things from your point of view, or the partnership won’t be possible.
<br><br>
    These are the kinds of issues in relationships that are difficult to overcome. Often differences in life goals are deal-breakers.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>29. A kind word here or there</b></h1>
  <p id="para">New relationship problems can include a lack of manners in numerous ways. Pleasantries like telling someone they look nice or saying thank you, or expressing how much you appreciate something they’ve done wane after a few dates. 
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    It shouldn’t—unfortunately, comfortability and taking a partner for granted set in quickly. If you notice this early on, say something, but also make sure to lead by example. Be the first to tell your mate these things often.
   </p></p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>30. Notice continued bad behaviors with a new relationship</b></h1>
  <p id="para">You’ll know you have early relationship problems if your mate is continuously on their phone when you’re together. That’s incredibly rude behavior for anyone when they’re with other people for any reason, let alone being on a date or in the early stages of a partnership. 
  <br><br>
    <p id="para"> <b> Solution: </b>
    <br><br>
    The focus should be on time spent with each other since free time is precious with the world’s hectic pace. When this happens at the start of a partnership, it won’t get better with time. It needs to be addressed and stopped to strengthen your union ultimately.

  <h1 id="name"><b>Talk to someone you trust</b></h1>
<p id="para">Without regular and positive contact, most of us feel lonely. For some people, loneliness happens every now and then. But for others, it can become our regular enemy. If you’re feeling lonely in a relationship, talk to someone about it.
<br><br>
  Sometimes parents aren’t always approving of relationships, but it’s important to consider why. Work at describing your situation in a way that will help them understand your relationship decisions. If your parents don’t agree with your choice of partner, it can be hard to talk to them about your relationship issues. But finding the courage and gradually working towards a healthy conversation is great for your confidence and self-esteem.
  <br><br>
  Talking to a close friend about your relationship can also help. Friendships change as you get older, so if you don’t talk to your old friends, try forming new friendships. You could join a book club, sporting club or find other activities you enjoy.</p>

  <h1 id="name">Working through your relationship challenges</h1>

  <p id="para">Relationships can be hard work. If things get tricky, there are a few ways you can work through your relationship struggles.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h1 id="name"><b>Communicate</b></h1>

While it may be difficult to start a conversation, you can practise effective communication techniques to get your point across and start a conversation.
<br><br>
    One strategy could be to ask your partner a relevant question, listen to their response, then offer your opinion. Once you’ve listened, you can then offer your side of the story.
    <br><br>
    While being honest with your partner may not be easy, it can help to work out your problems together. Remember that all relationships have their ups and downs, but going through a rough patch doesn’t mean it has to end. Sometimes it can get better – but it takes effort, understanding and trust.

<h1 id="name"><b>Respect your differences</b></h1>
  <p id="para">It’s important to respect your differences in a relationship. You might find that differences in culture, religion or opinion can be the source of difficulties or friction in relationships. Instead of ignoring or blaming the unfamiliar, make an effort to understand it and embrace it.

<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>Take a break</b></h1>
  <p id="para">Don’t be afraid to spend some time apart too. Taking a break in your relationship may help you both think about what you want, who you want to be with, and what you can do to make it work.
    </p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>Consider what’s best for you</b></h1>
  <p id="para">When you’ve found someone you love spending time with and doing life with, things can feel great. While it’s normal to experience the ups and downs of a relationship, if you find issues coming up constantly, or if you’re experiencing bigger issues like relationship abuse – this can affect your headspace. Think about whether the positives of your relationship outweigh the negatives. If you’re often feeling sad, hurt or angry, it may be worth ending the relationship. Doing this may even come with some unexpected positives.

    Relationship troubles can sometimes leave you with feelings of low mood and self-worth. Seeing a mental health professional can also help you focus on you and what you need, by tackling negative thoughts and talking through your
