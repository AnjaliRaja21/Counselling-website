<h1 id="name"><b> What is anxiety? </b></h1>

<p id="para">Anxiety is your body’s natural response to stress. It’s a feeling of fear or apprehension about what’s to come. For example, going to a job interview or giving a speech on the first day of school may cause some people to feel fearful and nervous.
<br><br>
  But if your feelings of anxiety are extreme, last for at least 6 months, and are interfering with your life, you may have an anxiety disorder.</p>
<br><br>
    


<h1 id="name"><b>What are anxiety disorders?</b></h1>
<p id="para">It’s normal to feel anxious about moving to a new place, starting a new job, or taking a test. This type of anxiety is unpleasant, but it may motivate you to work harder and do a better job. Ordinary anxiety is a feeling that comes and goes but doesn’t interfere with your everyday life.
<br><br>
  In the case of an anxiety disorder, the feeling of fear may be with you all the time. It’s intense and sometimes debilitating.
  <br><br>
  This type of anxiety may cause you to stop doing things you enjoy. For example, it may prevent you from entering an elevator, crossing the street, or even leaving your home in extreme cases. If left untreated, the anxiety will keep getting worse.</p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>What are the types of anxiety disorders?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Anxiety is a vital part of several different disorders. These include:
<br><br>
 <b> Panic disorder. </b> This means you experience recurring panic attacks at unexpected times.
  <br><br>
<b>  Phobia.</b> This is an excessive fear of a specific object, situation, or activity.
  <br><br>
<b>  Social anxiety disorder.</b> This is an extreme fear of being judged by others in social situations.
  <br><br>
 <b> Obsessive-compulsive disorder.</b> This means you have recurring irrational thoughts that lead you to perform specific, repeated behaviors.
  <br><br>
<b>  Separation anxiety disorder.</b> This means you have a fear of being away from home or your loved ones.
  <br><br>
<b>  Illness anxiety disorder.</b> This is anxiety about your health (formerly called hypochondria).</p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>What are the symptoms of anxiety?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Anxiety feels different depending on the person experiencing it. Feelings can range from butterflies in your stomach to a racing heart. You might feel out of control like there’s a disconnect between your mind and body.
<br>
  You may have a general feeling of fear and worry, or you may fear a specific place or event. In some cases, you may experience a panic attack.
  <br><br>
  SymptomsTrusted Source of anxiety can include:
  <br><br>
 1. anxious thoughts or beliefs that are difficult to control
 <br>
2. restlessness
<br>
 3. trouble concentrating
 <br>
 4. difficulty falling asleep
 <br>
 5. fatigue
 <br>
 6. irritability
 <br>
 7. unexplained aches and pains
 <br><br>
 Your anxiety symptoms might be different from someone else’s. That’s why it’s essential to know how anxiety can present itself.</p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>What causes anxiety?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Experts aren’t sure of the exact cause of anxiety. But it’s likely that a combination of factors play a role.
<br><br>
  The causes of anxiety may include:
  <br><br>
 1. stress
  <br>
 2. other medical issues such as depression or diabetes
  <br>
 3. first degree relatives with generalized anxiety disorder
  <br>
 4. environmental concerns, such as child abuse
  <br>
 5. substance use
  <br>
 6. situations such as surgery or occupational hazard
  <br><br>
  In addition, researchers believe that it stems from the areas of the brain responsible for controlling fear and the storing and retrieval of emotional and fear-related memories.</p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>Who is at risk of anxiety disorders?</b></h1>
<p id="para">With each type of anxiety, there are different risk factors. But there are some general influencesTrusted Source, including:
<br><br>
<b>  Personality traits. </b> This includes shyness and nervousness in childhood.
<br><br>
 <b> Life history. </b> This includes being exposed to negative or stressful live events.
 <br><br>
 <b> Genetics. </b> Of those who have a diagnosis of anxiety, 25 percentTrusted Source have a first degree relative who also has a diagnosis of anxiety.
 <br><br>
 <b> Other health conditions.</b> Thyroid problems and other health conditions can make you prone to anxiety.
 <br><br>
 <b> Stimulants. </b> Consuming caffeineTrusted Source, specific substances, and medications can worsen your symptoms.</p>
 <br><br>





<h1 id="name"><b>Are there tests that diagnose anxiety?</b></h1>
<p id="para">A single test can’t diagnose anxiety. Instead, an anxiety diagnosis requires a lengthy process of physical examinations, mental health tests, and psychological questionnaires.
<br><br>
  Some doctors or healthcare professionals may conduct a physical exam, including blood or urine tests to rule out underlying medical conditions that could contribute to the symptoms you’re experiencing.
  <br><br>
  Several anxiety tests and scales are also used to help a doctor assess the level of anxiety you’re experiencing.</p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>How can I treat anxiety?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Anxiety can be treated in a variety of ways. One common treatment option is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), which helps provide people with tools to cope with anxiety when it occurs.
<br><br>
  There are also certain medications, like antidepressants and sedatives, that work to balance brain chemistry and prevent episodes of anxiety. They may even ward off the most severe symptoms.
  <br><br>
  If you’re looking to go a more natural route, though, there are little and big ways you can help combat anxiety.
  <br><br>
  You can make adjustments to habits, like exercise, sleep, and diet. You can also try something totally new, like aromatherapy or meditation. No matter what your lifestyle demands, there’s a natural way to help reduce anxiety for everyone.</p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>What natural remedies are used for anxiety?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Lifestyle changes can effectively relieve some of the stress and anxiety you may cope with every day. Most natural “remedies” consist of caring for your body and participating in healthy activities while eliminating unhealthy ones.
<br><br>
  These include:
  <br><br>
  getting enough sleep
  <br>
  meditating
  <br>
  staying active and exercising
  <br>
  eating a healthy diet
  <br>
  avoiding alcohol
  <br>
  avoiding caffeine
  <br>
  quitting smoking cigarettes if you smoke</p>
  <br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>10 natural remedies for anxiety</b></h1>
<p id="mens1"><b>1. Stay active</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">Regular exercise isn’t just about physical health — it can be a huge help to your mental health, as well.
<br><br>
  A study found that people with anxiety disorders who reported a high level of physical activity were better protected against developing anxiety symptoms. This could be for a variety of reasons. Exercise can divert your attention away from something that’s making you anxious.
  <br><br>
  Getting your heart rate up also changes the brain chemistry to create more space for anti-anxiety neurochemicals, like:
  <br><br>
  serotonin
  <br>
  gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)
  <br>
  brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)
  <br>
  endocannabinoids
  <br><br>
  Regular exercise leads to an enhancement of concentration and willpower, which can help certain anxiety symptoms. When it comes to what type of exercise, this is more of a personal preference. If you’re looking to really get your heart rate up, something like a HIIT class (high-intensity interval training) or running is your best bet.
  <br><br>
  But if you’re looking to start off with something with a little lower impact, workouts, like Pilates and yoga, could also be just as beneficial for your mental health.</p>
<br>

</div>
<br>


<p id="mens1"><b>2. Meditate and practice mindfulness</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">A main goal of meditation is full awareness of the present moment, which includes noticing all thoughts in a nonjudgmental way. This can lead to a sense of calm and contentment by increasing your ability to mindfully tolerate all thoughts and feelings.
<br><br>
  Meditation is known to relieve stress and anxiety. Research suggests 30 minutes of daily meditation may alleviate some anxiety symptoms and act as an antidepressant.</p>
<br><br>



<p id="mens1"><b>3. Eat a balanced diet</b></p>
<br>
<p  id="para">Low blood sugar levels, dehydration, or chemicals in processed foods, such as artificial flavorings, artificial coloring, and preservatives, may cause mood changes in some people. A high-sugar diet may also impact temperament.
<br><br>
  If your anxiety worsens after eating, check your eating habits. Stay hydrated, eliminate processed foods, and eat a balanced diet rich in complex carbohydrates, fruits and vegetables, and lean proteins.</p>
<br><br>



<p id="mens1"><b>4. Practice deep breathing</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">Shallow, fast breathing is common with anxiety. It may lead to a fast heart rate, dizziness or lightheadedness, or even a panic attack.
<br><br>
  Deep breathing exercises — the deliberate process of taking slow, even, deep breaths — can help restore normal breathing patterns and reduce anxiety.</p>
<br><br>



<p id="mens1"><b>5. Steer clear of alcohol</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">Drinking alcohol may take the edge off at first, since it’s a natural sedative. However, researchTrusted Source suggests there’s a link between anxiety and alcohol consumption, with anxiety disorders and alcohol use disorder (AUD) occurring hand-in-hand. A studies showed that decreasing alcohol intake can improve both anxiety and depression.
  <br><br>
  Heavy drinking can interfere with the balance of neurotransmitters, which can be responsible for positive mental health. This interference creates an imbalance that may lead to certain symptoms of anxiety.
  <br><br>
  Anxiety may temporarily increase in early sobriety but can improve in the long run.
  <br><br>
  Alcohol has also been shown to disrupt your body’s natural ability to sleep by interfering with sleep homeostasis. And as we’ll later point out, a good night’s sleep is incredibly helpful when combating anxiety.</p>
<br><br>



<p id="mens1"><b>6. Consider quitting smoking cigarettes</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">Smokers often reach for a cigarette during stressful times. Yet, like drinking alcohol, taking a drag on a cigarette when you’re stressed is a quick fix that may worsen anxiety over time.
<br><br>
  Research has shown that the earlier you start smoking in life, the higher your risk of developing an anxiety disorder later. Research also suggests nicotine and other chemicals in cigarette smoke alter pathways in the brain linked to anxiety.
  <br><br>
  If you’re looking to quit, there are lots of different ways you can get started. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)Trusted Source recommends finding a safe substitute for cigarettes, like toothpicks.
  <br><br>
  You can also take up habits that may distract you in order to create an environment that works for your smoke-free life. Additionally, you can make a plan with a support system who can provide everything from encouragement to distractions.</p>
<br><br>



<p id="mens1"><b>7. Limit caffeine intake</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">If you have chronic anxiety, caffeine is not your friend. Caffeine may cause nervousness and jitters, neither of which is good if you’re anxious.
<br><br>
  Research has shown caffeine may cause or worsen anxiety disorders. It may also cause panic attacks in people with panic disorder. In some people, eliminating caffeine may significantly improve anxiety symptoms.
  <br><br>
  Similar to alcohol, caffeine and anxiety are often linked, due to caffeine’s ability to alter brain chemistry.
  <br><br>
  For example, a study showed that caffeine increases alertness by blocking the brain chemical adenosine, which is what makes you feel tired, while at the same time triggering the release of adrenalin.
  <br><br>
  With all this being said, a moderate intake of caffeine is safe for most people.
  <br><br>
  However, if you’re looking to cut back or completely cut out caffeine, you’ll want to start by slowly reducing the amount of caffeine you drink daily.
  <br><br>
  Start replacing these drinks with water to quench the thirst. This will not only satisfy your body’s need to drink a liquid, but it will also help flush caffeine from your body and keep you hydrated.
  <br><br>
  Gradually reducing your caffeine over the course of a few weeks can help adjust the habit without the body going through withdrawal.</p>
<br><br>




<p id="mens1"><b>8. Prioritize getting a good night’s rest</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">Sleep has been proven time and time again to be an important part of good mental health.
<br><br>
  Even though a survey found that nearly a third of adults get less than 6 hours of sleep a night, the CDC recommendsTrusted Source that adults get 7 to 9 hours of sleep every day.
  <br><br>
  You can make sleep a priority by:
  <br><br>
 1. only sleeping at night when you’re tired
  <br>
 2. not reading or watching television in bed
  <br>
 3. not using your phone, tablet, or computer in bed
  <br>
 4. not tossing and turning in your bed or going to another room if you can’t sleep
  <br>
 5. avoiding caffeine, large meals, and nicotine before bedtime
  <br>
 6. keeping your room dark and cool
  <br>
 7. writing down your worries before going to bed
  <br>
 8. going to sleep at the same time each night</p>
<br><br>



<p id="mens1"><b>9. Try aromatherapy</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">Aromatherapy is a holistic healing treatment that has been used by humans for thousands of years. The practice uses natural plant extracts and essential oils to promote the health and well-being of the mind, body, and spirit. Its goal is to enhance both physical and emotional health.
<br><br>
  The essential oils created by the natural plant extracts may be inhaled directly or added to a warm bath or diffuser. Aromatherapy is suggested to:
  <br><br>
 1. help you relax
 2. help you sleep
 3. boost mood
 4. reduce heart rate and blood pressure</p>
<br><br>



<p id="mens1"><b>10. Drink chamomile tea</b></p>
<br>
<p id="para">A cup of chamomile tea is a common home remedy to calm frayed nerves and promote sleep.
<br><br>
  A study found people who took German chamomile capsules (220 milligrams up to five times daily) had a greater reduction in test scores that measure anxiety symptoms than those who were given a placebo.
  <br><br>
  Another study found that chamomile extract helped sleep-disturbed rats fall asleep. Researchers believe that the tea may function like benzodiazepine, binding to benzodiazepine receptors and having benzodiazepine-like hypnotic activity.</p>
<br><br>



<h1 id="name"><b>Takeaway</b></h1>
<p id="para">If you’re feeling anxious, the above ideas may help calm you down. If your goal is to feel better, incorporating these practices into your anxiety treatment plan may be helpful.
<br><br>
  Remember, home remedies may help ease anxiety, but they don’t replace professional help. Increased anxiety may require therapy or prescription medication. Talk with your doctor about your concerns.
