  <h1 id="name"><b>What is self-esteem?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Self-esteem refers to your opinion of yourself. It is said that every person has 3 sets of personalities, traits, beliefs, abilities and so on.
<br><br>
 1. The first type of self is the ideal self. This is the type of person that you want to become.
  <br>
 2. The second type of self is the actual self. This is who you really are as a person.
  <br>
3. The third type of self is the perceived self. This is how you view yourself or who you think you are.
  <br>
  The thing is, your perceived self can be quite different from your actual self.
  <br><br>
  For instance, you might be very attractive to everyone else, but you might not see yourself as attractive at all. Or you might think that you are a really funny person, while in reality you might not be!
  <br><br>
  It is your perceived perception of yourself, that determines how much self-esteem you have. And this is very important.
  <br><br>
  That’s because self-esteem is defined as your subjective evaluation of your own worth.
<br><br>
  If you think that you are worth less than everybody else, it will impact your life in negative ways.
  <br>
  On the other hand, if you think too highly of yourself, this too can have a negative impact on your life.
  <br><br>
  Due to the importance of self-esteem in our lives, countless research studies have been conducted on the matter. They have led to many interesting findings that you should be aware of in order to understand this concept better. </p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>What is low self-esteem?</b></h1>
<p id="para">People with low self-esteem have a poor opinion of themselves. Some characteristics may include that you may:
<br><br>
  not like yourself very much
  <br>
  assume that others don’t like you because you’re unlikeable or damaged
  <br>
  think of yourself as unlovable or unworthy of love
  <br><br>
  Everyone has moments of doubt about who they are and what they’ve achieved. You may do or say something that makes you temporarily ashamed of or annoyed with yourself. Those temporary or periodic feelings are not the same as low self-esteem.
  <br><br>
  Low self-esteem refers to long-term negativity about who you are and how you show up in the world. These negative feelings can be persistent and hard to challenge. For example, if someone compliments you, you may not believe them. If you achieve a goal, you may not allow yourself to take credit for it.</p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>What causes low self-esteem?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Feelings of self-esteem can change over time by newly manifesting or coming back in adulthood.
<br><br>
  You may do something — or have something done to you — that lowers your opinion of yourself at any point during your life. In some instances, this may be linked to behaviors that are out of sync with your value system or personal ethics. It may also be caused by being in an abusive relationship with a romantic partner, boss, or significant other.
  <br><br>
  The roots of self-esteem are often found in early childhood or adolescence. Genetics may also play a role. In some instances, a combination of genetic and environmental factors may influence a person’s self-esteem. </p>
<br><h1 id="name">Early causes</h1>
<p id="para">
Early negative experiences can cause you to have a poor opinion of yourself.
<br><br>
Yet, people have widely varying levels of resilience to outside circumstances. You can experience one or more causes of low self-esteem without it actually affecting your personal self-esteem.
<br><br>
Potential causes of low self-esteem during childhood and adolescence include:
<br><br>
<b>~</b> experiencing ongoing harsh criticism from authority figures, such as parents or teachers
<br>
<b>~</b> being raised by emotionally distant parents or caregivers
<br>
<b>~</b> going through childhood trauma, such as parental divorce or sexual abuse
<br>
<b>~</b> having trouble keeping up at school
<br>
<b>~</b> having a physical or mental disability
<br>
<b>~</b> feeling less attractive than the ideal image portrayed in social media</p>
<br><h1 id="name">Genes And Environment</h1>
<p id="para">For decades, there had been a raging debate on how self-esteem is developed. Some researchers believed that it depends on genes and some believed that it depends on the environment you are born in.
  <br><br>
  A study found that there are specific genes that influence your confidence and self-esteem.
  <br><br>
  So, for most people, genes may influence their level of self-esteem.
  <br><br>
  However, the effect that your upbringing had on you cannot be ignored. The environment that you have been exposed to since your childhood also plays a huge role in determining the kind of self-esteem you have.</p>
<br><br>


<h1 id="name"><b>What are the signs of low self-esteem?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Characteristics of people with low self-esteem include:
<br><br>
 1. having self-deprecating internal conversations with yourself (negative self-talk)
 <br>
 2. comparing yourself negatively to others
 <br>
 3. ignoring your achievements or not believing you are responsible for them
 <br>
 4. blaming yourself for circumstances beyond your control
 <br>
 5. not accepting or believing compliments
 <br>
 6. avoiding challenges or goal setting
 <br>
 7. thinking you don’t deserve happiness, love, or fun
 <br>
 8. not handling criticism well
 <br>
 9. feeling shame and worthlessness
 <br>
 10. focusing too much on physical characteristics, such as weight and height</p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>What effect can low self-esteem have on your health?</b></h1>
<p id="para">Having bad feelings about yourself can lead to an increase in anxiety and depression. This can cause self-isolation and poor quality of life. It may also increase the risk of self-harming behaviors such as cutting, substance misuse, and suicide.
<br><br>
  A study on students found an association between low self-esteem and anxiety, depression, and suicidal ideation. Educational stress and emotional abuse by parents or other adults were risk factors for these feelings.
  <br><br>
  Low self-esteem has also been linked to disordered eating</p>
<br><br>



  <h1 id="name"><b>How to Build Self-Esteem</b></h1>
<p id="para">Low self-esteem can become a deeply ingrained part of your nature. But by practicing self-care, you can improve low self-esteem and reduce its effect on your daily life.
  <br><br>The good news is there are ways to build up your self-esteem. While it won’t happen overnight, with the right strategies and mindset, you can take steps toward changing the way you feel about yourself.

<br>
<h1 id="name"><b>Take care of your needs first</b></h1>
<p id="para">If you’re always looking after everyone else’s needs and forgetting your own, you’re not valuing yourself enough. Adding in more self-care to your daily routine can help you counter negative thoughts and build up your self-worth.
<br><br>
  Here are some ways you can show yourself some love:
  <br><br>
 1. Nurture your body by getting a massage or facial.
  <br>
 2. Do your favorite workout at least 30 minutes each day.
  <br>
 3. Unplug from your phone or take a social media detox.
  <br>
 4. Treat yourself to a nourishing meal.
  <br>
 5. Practice self-compassion; talk nicely to yourself.
  <br><br>
  Even just making sure you’re eating regularly and prioritizing sleep can give your self-worth a boost.
  </p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>Embrace the awkward</b></h1>
<p id="para">There are going to me moments when you fumble — it’s just part of life. But accepting this fact can help you feel more comfortable in your own skin.
<br><br>
  The next time you find yourself feeling embarrassed or self-conscious, try to laugh it off.</p>


<br>
<h1 id="name"><b>Challenge negative thoughts</b></h1>
<p id="para">It’s easy to be hard on ourselves after stumbling or making a mistake. But beating yourself up because you didn’t score that big promotion or forgot to make an important phone call keeps you stuck in a negative cycle of shame and self-loathing.
<br><br>
  Try to practice countering your negative thoughts as they come up:
  <br><br>
 ~ Forgive yourself and understand these are isolated instances that don’t define you as a person.
 <br>
 ~ Write down your negative thoughts so that you can step back and simply observe them.
 <br>
 ~ Consider what you’ve learned from the experience and re-focus on the positive.</p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>Spend time with people who love you</b></h1>
<p id="para">There’s nothing like surrounding yourself with loving, supportive people to build up your confidence and make you feel accepted for who you are.
<br><br>
  Make a plan to set up more coffee dates and get-togethers with your nearest and dearest. Seeing yourself through the eyes of those who care about you will help you appreciate your own unique qualities and perspectives.</p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>Step away from troubling situations</b></h1>
<p id="para">Think about the times you’ve felt especially insecure. Who were you with? What were you doing?
<br><br>
  Noticing the people and situations that deflate your self-esteem can help you pinpoint what to avoid. If you’re surrounding yourself with so-called “friends” who make it a habit of pointing out your flaws, it’s a clear sign to find better company.</p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>Reflect on the good</b></h1>
<p id="para">Celebrate your successes and talk yourself up when you’ve had a big win at work. Being proud of what you do, even if it seems awkward at first, can have a powerful effect on your self-esteem.
<br><br>
  Keep a reminder on hand to help boost your confidence throughout the day by:
  <br><br>
 ~ saving compliments people have given you on your desktop or notes app
 <br>
 ~ writing out all of your accomplishments to review them when you’re feeling insecure
 <br>
 ~ taking a few minutes each day to list three things you appreciate about yourself</p>



<h1 id="name"><b>Do things that bring you joy</b></h1>
<p id="para">Prioritize spending free time doing things that bring you joy and happiness, whether it’s curling up with a book or cooking a good meal from scratch.
<br><br>
  Even better, consider learning a new skill or taking up a hobby you’ve always wanted to try. Aside from making you happy, mastering a new skill is a good reminder of your talents and interests.</p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>Focus on baby steps</b></h1>
<p id="para">Overcoming insecurity and building up your self-esteem don’t happen overnight. Try to be kind to yourself during this process and don’t get discouraged if things aren’t improving as fast as you’d like them too.
<br><br>
  Even if you don’t feel confident today, the small baby steps you are taking now will eventually grow into bigger steps and keep you moving forward.</p>
<br>



<h1 id="name"><b>Work with a therapist</b></h1>
<p id="para">Speaking with a qualified therapist can help you explore your fears and insecurities by understanding where they come from. They can also help you develop new tools for navigating situations that zap your confidence.</p>
<br><br>
<p id="para"><b>Low self-esteem can be treated and improved. In many instances, self-care will be enough to give you a more positive, realistic view of yourself. If self-care is not enough to provide relief, seeking professional help can be highly beneficial.</b></p>
