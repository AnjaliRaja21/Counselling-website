        </div> 
    
        <h1 id="priv1">What’s covered in these terms <br><br> We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use services, and what we expect from you.</h1>
           
<br>
        <p id="priv2">These Terms of Service reflect the way that site business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things that we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define site relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:</p>
        <br>
        <ol>
            <li><b> What you can expect from us,</b> which describes how we provide and develop our services</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b> What we expect from you,</b> which establishes certain rules for using our services</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b> Content in site services,</b> which describes the intellectual property rights to the content that you find in our services – whether that content belongs to you, site or others</li>
            <br><br>
            <li><b> In case of problems or disagreements,</b> which describes other legal rights that you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms.</li>
        </ol>
        <br><br>
        <p id="priv2">Understanding these terms is important because, by using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms. <br><br>Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export and delete your information. These terms help define the relationship between you and site. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to use our services if you agree to follow these terms. Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services.  As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.
<br><br><br>If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements or addressing security and operability issues. The permission that we give you to use our services continues as long as you comply with these terms. 
<br><br>Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights that we have in the services. We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means that you must follow these terms.
<br><br>don’t abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt the services – for example, by accessing or using them in fraudulent or deceptive ways, introducing malware or spamming, hacking or bypassing our systems or protective measures. Some of our services are designed to let you upload, submit, store, send, receive or share your content. You have no obligation to provide any content to our services and you’re free to choose the content that you want to provide. If you choose to upload or share content, please make sure that you have the necessary rights to do so and that the content is lawful.
<br><br><br>If you choose to give us feedback, such as suggestions to improve our services, we may act on your feedback without obligation to you.
