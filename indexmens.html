<h1 id="name">Every month, 1.8 billion people across the world menstruate. Millions of these girls, women, transgender men and non-binary persons are unable to manage their menstrual cycle in a dignified, healthy way.
<br><br>


  </h1>
  <p id="mens1"><b> Here is a small attempt to normalize the menstrual cycle by debusting some of the common myths about periods in India: </b></p>
  <br>
<h1 id="name">Myth: Women shed impure blood during periods.</h1>
<p id="para"><b>Fact: </b>This is an extremely common misconception that period blood is dirty or impure. However, what most people fail to understand is that the menstrual cycle is part of a woman’s reproductive system that prepares her body for a (possible) pregnancy. The menstrual blood is also the same blood that circulates throughout the body. <br>
  The clumping and color of period blood have their scientific causes too. Women shed partly blood and partly tissue from the inside of the uterus. In addition, the color may range from light red to dark brown. The change in color from standard red occurs due to the reaction of blood with oxygen (it gets time to oxidize). Dark brown or blackish color is usually associated with the beginning or end of your periods.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="name">Myth: If you miss your period, you are pregnant.</h1>
<p id="para"><b>Fact: </b> A late or missed period does not necessarily point out that you are pregnant. Hormonal imbalances like polycystic ovary syndrome, excessive weight, unhealthy diet, illness, stress can be the causes of your missed or irregular periods too.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="name">Myth: You cannot exercise while you are on your period.</h1>
<p id="para"><b>Fact: </b> There is no scientific evidence that exercising while you are on your period can harm your physical health. In fact, exercise is good for a sound body and mind and can even help to reduce the pain due to menstrual cramps. There are no risks to regular physical activity, like walking. Certain yoga asanas may help you feel better during your period cramps. You can discuss with a wellness expert to know what exercises can safely be done during periods. The best bet can be to avoid a high-intensity workout.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="name">Myth: You can’t get pregnant while on your period.</h1>
<p id="para"><b>Fact: </b> While it is uncommon to get pregnant while you are on your periods, it is not completely impossible. One may get pregnant if she is having a short menstrual cycle. The average length of a cycle is 28-30 days. If a woman having a shorter menstrual cycle have sex towards the end of the six-day-long period, followed by ovulation shortly after, the chances are that some of the sperm may survive and lead to pregnancy.
<br><br>
  Another reason can be a false alarm. Some women may see some spotting or bleeding during ovulation. Ovulation occurs when the woman’s ovary releases an egg and it is the most fertile window of the reproductive cycle. If it is confused as a period, the chances of getting pregnant shall be high.</p>
  <br>
  <h1 id="name">Myth: You shouldn’t wash your hair during your period.</h1>
  <p id="para"><b>Fact: </b> You don’t need to compromise with your personal hygiene habits due to your periods. There is no study that states one cannot wash your hair or take a shower on your period. In fact, a warm bath can help you with the painful cramps.</p>
  <br>
  <h1 id="name">Myth: If you use a tampon, you lose your virginity.</h1>
  <p id="para"><b>Fact: </b>While it is true that tampons may cause the hymen to stretch which a few times may cause breaking of the hymen, it does not cause someone to lose their virginity. Virginity is much beyond just the hymen. The hymen can be naturally broken due to strenuous activities like cycling too. However, usually, when a tampon is inserted, the hymen will stretch to accommodate it, so the odds of affecting a woman’s virginity can be less.</p>
  <br>
  <h1 id="name">Myth: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is all in the mind. It’s unreal.</h1>
  <p id="para"><b>Fact: </b>PMS symptoms are real and occur a week or two before the periods. They are related to the way hormones change during a woman’s monthly cycle. Over 90% of women have noticed they get some premenstrual symptoms, such as bloating, headaches, and mood changes like irritation, depression, etc. Fatigue, cramps, and headache are some of the commonest symptoms of PMS. Usually, the symptoms are worst 4 days before a period and start relieving 2 to 3 days after the period begins.</p>

<br><br>
  <h1 id="name"><b> Menstrual Disorders </b></h1>
  <br>
  <p id="para">Menstrual disorders are problems that affect a woman's normal menstrual cycle. There are several types of menstrual disorders. Problems can range from heavy, painful periods to no periods at all. There are many variations in menstrual patterns, but in general women should be concerned when periods come fewer than 21 days or more than 3 months apart, or if they last more than 10 days. Such events may indicate ovulation problems or other medical conditions. Menstrual disorders include:<br><br> ~  <b> Dysmenorrhea </b> refers to painful cramps during menstruation. <br> ~ <b> Premenstrual </b> syndrome refers to physical and psychological symptoms occurring prior to menstruation. <br>~ <b> Menorrhagia </b> is heavy bleeding, including prolonged menstrual periods or excessive bleeding during a normal-length period. <br>~ <b> Metrorrhagia </b> is bleeding at irregular intervals, particularly between expected menstrual periods. <br>~ <b> Amenorrhea </b> is the absence of menstruation. <br>~ <b> Oligomenorrhea </b> refers to infrequent menstrual periods. Hypomenorrhea refers to light periods.
  </p>
  <br>

  <p id="mens1"><b> Dysmenorrhea (Painful Cramps) </b></p>
  
  <p id="para">Dysmenorrhea is severe, frequent cramping during menstruation. Pain occurs in the lower abdomen but can spread to the lower back and thighs. Dysmenorrhea is usually referred to as primary or secondary: <br><br><b>~ Primary dysmenorrhea.</b> Cramping pain caused by menstruation. The cramps occur from contractions in the uterus and are usually more severe during heavy bleeding. <br><b>~ Secondary dysmenorrhea.</b>  Menstrual-related pain that accompanies another medical or physical condition, such as endometriosis or uterine fibroids.</p>
  <br><br>


  <p id="mens1"><b> Menorrhagia (Heavy Bleeding) </b></p>
  <br>
  <p id="para"><b>Menorrhagia </b>is the medical term for significantly heavier periods. Menorrhagia can be caused by a number of factors.
    During a normal menstrual cycle, the average woman loses about 1 ounce (30 mL) of blood and changes her sanitary products around 3 to 5 times per day.
    <br><br>
    With menorrhagia, menstrual flow lasts longer and is heavier than normal. The bleeding occurs at regular intervals (during periods), but may last more than 7 days, and menstrual flow soaks more than 5 sanitary products per day or requires product change during the night. Clot formation is common. Menorrhagia is often accompanied by dysmenorrhea because passing large clots can cause painful cramping.</p>
    <br><br>


    <p id="mens1"><b> Metrorrhagia </b></p>
    <p id="para">Also called breakthrough bleeding, refers to bleeding that occurs at irregular intervals and with variable amounts. The bleeding occurs between periods or is unrelated to periods. Spotting or light bleeding between periods is common in girls just starting menstruation and sometimes during ovulation in young adult women.</p>
    <br><br>

<p id="mens1"><b> Amenorrhea (Absence of Menstruation) </b></p>
    <p id="para">Amenorrhea is the absence of menstruation. There are two categories: primary amenorrhea and secondary amenorrhea. These terms refer to the time when menstruation stops: <br><br><b>~ Primary amenorrhea. </b>Occurs when a girl does not begin to menstruate by age 16. Girls who show no signs of sexual development (breast development and pubic hair) by age 13 should be evaluated by a doctor. Any girl who does not have her period by age 15 should be evaluated for primary amenorrhea. <br><b>~ Secondary amenorrhea. </b>Occurs when periods that were previously regular stop for at least 3 months.</p>
    <br><br>

    <p id="mens1"><b> Oligomenorrhea (Infrequent Menstruation) and Hypomenorrhea (Light Menstruation) </b></p>
    <p id="para"><b>Oligomenorrhea </b>is a condition in which menstrual cycles are infrequent, occurring more than 35 days apart. It is very common in early adolescence and does not usually indicate a medical problem. Light or scanty flow is also common in the first years after menarche and before menopause.
<br><br>
      When girls first menstruate they often do not have regular cycles for several years. Even healthy cycles in adult women can vary by a few days from month to month. Periods may occur every 3 weeks in some women, and every 5 weeks in others. Flow also varies and can be heavy or light. Skipping a period and then having a heavy flow may occur; this is most likely due to missed ovulation rather than a miscarriage.</p>
    <br><br>

    <p id="mens1"><b> Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS) </b></p>
    <p id="para">Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is a set of physical, emotional, and behavioral symptoms that occur during the last week of the luteal phase (a week before menstruation) in most cycles. The symptoms typically do not start until at least day 13 in the cycle, and resolve within 4 days after bleeding begins.
<br><br>
      Women may begin to have premenstrual syndrome symptoms at any time during their reproductive years, but it usually occurs when they are in their late 20s to early 40s. Once established, the symptoms tend to remain fairly constant until menopause, although they can vary from cycle to cycle.</p>
    <br><br>

<br>

<h1 id="name"><b>Causes</b></h1>
    <p id="para">Many different factors can trigger menstrual disorders, including hormone imbalances, genetic factors, clotting disorders, and pelvic diseases.</p>
    <br><br>
    <p id="mens1"><b> Causes of Dysmenorrhea (Painful Periods)</b></p>
    <p id="para">Primary dysmenorrhea is caused by prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that are produced in the uterus and cause the uterine muscle to contract. Prostaglandins also play a role in the heavy bleeding that causes dysmenorrhea.
<br><br>
      Secondary dysmenorrhea can be caused by a number of medical conditions. Common causes of secondary dysmenorrhea include:
      <br><br>
     <b>~ Endometriosis. </b> Endometriosis is a chronic and often progressive disease that develops when the tissue that lines the uterus (endometrium) grows onto other areas, such as the ovaries, peritoneum, bowels, or bladder. It often causes chronic pelvic pain.
     <br><b>~ Uterine Fibroids. </b> Fibroids are noncancerous growths on the walls of the uterus. They can cause heavy bleeding during menstruation and cramping pain.
     <br><b>~ Other Causes. </b> Pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cysts, and ectopic pregnancy. The intrauterine device (IUD) contraceptive can also cause secondary dysmenorrhea.</p>
    <br><br>


    <p id="mens1"><b>Causes of Menorrhagia (Heavy Bleeding) </b></p>
    <p id="para">There are many possible causes for heavy bleeding:
<br><br>
     <b>~ Hormonal Imbalances. </b> Imbalances in estrogen and progesterone levels can cause heavy bleeding. Hormonal imbalances are common around the time of menarche and menopause.
   <br> <br><b>~ Ovulation Problems. </b> If ovulation does not occur (anovulation), the body stops producing progesterone, which can cause heavy bleeding.
    <br><br><b>~ Uterine Fibroids. </b> Uterine fibroids are a very common cause of heavy and prolonged bleeding.
    <br><br><b>~ Uterine Polyps. </b> Uterine polyps (small benign growths) and other structural problems or other abnormalities in the uterine cavity may cause bleeding.
    <br><br><b>~ Endometriosis and Adenomyosis.</b> Endometriosis, a condition in which the cells that line the uterus grow outside of the uterus in other areas, such as the ovaries, can cause heavy bleeding. Adenomyosis, a related condition where endometrial tissue develops within the muscle layers of the uterus, can also cause heavy bleeding and menstrual pain.
    <br><br><b>~ Medications and Contraceptives. </b> Certain drugs, including anticoagulants and anti-inflammatory medications, can cause heavy bleeding. Problems linked to some birth control methods, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUDs) can cause bleeding.
     <br><br><b>~ Bleeding Disorders.</b> Bleeding disorders that reduce blood clotting can cause heavy menstrual bleeding. Most of these disorders have a genetic basis. Von Willebrand disease is the most common of these bleeding disorders.
    <br><br><b>~ Cancer.</b> Rarely, uterine, ovarian, and cervical cancer can cause excessive bleeding.
     <br><br><b>~ Infection. </b> Infection of the uterus or cervix can cause bleeding.
    <br><br><b>~ Pregnancy or Miscarriage.</b> Spotting is very common during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. Heavier bleeding may also occur. Heavy bleeding during the first trimester may be a sign of miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy, but it may also be due to less serious causes that do not harm the woman or her baby.
    <br><br><b>~ Other Medical Conditions.</b> Systemic lupus erythematosus, diabetes, pelvic inflammatory disorder, cirrhosis, and thyroid disorders can cause heavy bleeding.</p>
<br><br>


<p id="mens1"><b> Causes of Amenorrhea and Oligomenorrhea (Absent or Infrequent Periods) </b></p>
    <p id="para">Normal causes of skipped or irregular periods include pregnancy, breastfeeding, hormonal contraception, and perimenopause. Skipped periods are also common during adolescence, when it may take a while before ovulation occurs regularly. Consistently absent periods may be due to the following factors:
<br><br>
    <b>~ Delayed Puberty. </b> A common cause of primary amenorrhea (absence of periods) is delayed puberty due to genetic factors. Failure of ovarian development is the most common cause of primary amenorrhea.
     <br><br><b>~ Hormonal Changes and Puberty. </b> Oligomenorrhea (infrequent menstruation) is commonly experienced by girls who are just beginning to have their periods.
    <br><br><b>~ Weight Loss and Eating Disorders. </b> Eating disorders are a common cause of amenorrhea in adolescent girls. Extreme weight loss and reduced fat stores lead to hormonal changes that include low thyroid levels (hypothyroidism) and elevated stress hormone levels (hypercortisolism). These changes produce a reduction in reproductive hormones.
    <br><br><b> ~ Athletic Training. </b> Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea associated with vigorous physical activity may be related to stress and weight loss. A syndrome known as the female athlete triad is associated with hormonal changes that occur with the combination of eating disorders, amenorrhea, and osteopenia (loss of bone density that can lead to osteoporosis) in young women who excessively exercise.
    <br><br><b> ~ Stress. </b> Physical and emotional stress may block the release of luteinizing hormone, causing temporary amenorrhea.
    <br><br><b> ~ Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). </b> PCOS is a condition in which the ovaries produce high amounts of androgens (male hormones), particularly testosterone. Amenorrhea or oligomenorrhea is quite common in women who have PCOS.
    <br><br><b> ~ Elevated Prolactin Levels (Hyperprolactinemia). </b> Prolactin is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland that stimulates breast development and milk production in association with pregnancy. High levels of prolactin (hyperprolactinemia) in women who are not pregnant or nursing can reduce gonadotropin hormones and inhibit ovulation, thus causing amenorrhea.
     <br><br><b>~ Premature Ovarian Failure (POF). </b> POF is the early depletion of follicles before age 40. In most cases, it leads to premature menopause. POF is a significant cause of infertility.
    <br><br><b> ~ Structural Problems. </b> In some cases, structural problems or scarring in the uterus may prevent menstrual flow. Inborn genital tract abnormalities may also cause primary amenorrhea.
     <br><br><b>~ Other Medical Conditions. </b> Epilepsy, thyroid problems, celiac sprue, metabolic syndrome, and Cushing's disease are associated with amenorrhea.
    <br><br>  If the ovaries produce too much androgen (hormones such as testosterone) a woman may develop male characteristics. This ovarian imbalance can be caused by tumors in the ovaries or adrenal glands, or polycystic ovarian disease. Virilization may include growth of excess body and facial hair, amenorrhea (loss of menstrual period) and changes in body contour.</p>
    <br><br>
    <h1 id="name"><b>Lifestyle Changes</b></h1>
    <br>
<div align="center">
<img src="Period .jpg" alt="girl" id="padd">
</div>
   <br><br>
    <p id="mens1">Dietary Factors</p>
    <p id="para">Dietary adjustments, starting about 14 days before a period may help some women with certain mild menstrual disorders, such as cramping. The general guidelines for a healthy diet apply to everyone; they include properly hydrating, eating plenty of whole grains, fresh fruits and vegetables, and avoiding saturated fats and commercial junk foods.
<br><br>
      Limiting salt (sodium) may help reduce bloating. Limiting caffeine, sugar, and alcohol intake may also be beneficial.</p>
<br><br>
<p id="mens1">Preventing and Treating Anemia</p>
    <p id="para"><b>Dietary Forms of Iron</b></p>
    <p id="para">Women who have heavy menstrual bleeding can sometimes become anemic. Eating iron-rich foods can help prevent anemia. Iron found in foods is either in the form of heme or non-heme iron. Heme iron is better absorbed than non-heme iron.

    <br><br> ~ Foods containing heme iron are the best sources for increasing or maintaining healthy iron levels. Such foods include clams, oysters, organ meats, beef, pork, poultry, and fish.
    <br> ~ Non-heme iron is less well absorbed. A substantial amount of the iron in meat is non-heme (although meat itself helps absorb non-heme iron). Eggs, dairy products, and iron-containing vegetables have only the non-heme form. Such vegetable products include dried beans and peas, iron-fortified cereals, bread, and pasta products, dark green leafy vegetables (chard, spinach, mustard greens, and kale), dried fruits, nuts, and seeds.
    <br><br>  Increasing intake of vitamin C rich foods can enhance absorption of non-heme iron.</p>
<br><br>

<p id="para"><b>Iron Supplements</b></p>
<p id="para">There are two forms of supplemental iron: ferrous and ferric. Ferrous iron is better absorbed and is the preferred form of iron tablets. Ferrous iron is available in three forms: ferrous fumarate, ferrous sulfate, and ferrous gluconate. Depending on the severity of your anemia, as well as your age and weight, your doctor will recommend a dosage of 60mg to 200 mg of elemental iron per day. This means taking 1 iron pill 2 to 3 times each day.</p>
<br><br>
<p id="mens1">Other Lifestyle Measures</p>
<br>
<p id="para"><b>Exercise</b></p>
<p id="para">Exercise may help reduce menstrual pain.</p>
<br>
<p id="para"><b>Applying Heat</b></p>
<p id="para">Applying a heating pad to the abdominal area, or soaking in a hot bath, can help relieve the pain of menstrual cramps.</p>
<br>
<p id="para"><b>Menstrual Hygiene</b></p>
<p id="para">Change tampons every 4 to 6 hours. Avoid scented pads and tampons; feminine deodorants can irritate the genital area. Douching is not recommended because it can destroy the natural bacteria normally present in the vagina. Bathing regularly is sufficient.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="name"><b>Medications</b></h1>
    <p id="para">There are a number of different medicines prescribed for menstrual disorders.</p>
<br>
<h1 id="mens1">Common Pain Relievers for Cramps</h1>
<br>
<p id="para"><b>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)</b></p>
<p id="para">NSAIDs block prostaglandins, the substances that increase uterine contractions. They are effective painkillers that also help control the inflammatory factors that may be responsible for heavy menstrual bleeding.
<br><br>
  Among the most effective NSAIDs for menstrual disorders are ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, Midol PMS) and naproxen (Aleve), which are both available over-the-counter, and mefenamic acid (Ponstel), which requires a doctor's prescription. Long-term daily use of any NSAID can increase the risk for gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers, so it is best to just use these drugs for a few days during the menstrual cycle.
  <br><br>
 <b> Acetaminophen </b> (Tylenol) is a good alternative to NSAIDs, especially for women with stomach problems or ulcers. Some products (Pamprin, Premsyn) combine acetaminophen with other drugs, such as a diuretic, to reduce bloating.</p>
<br><br>
<h1 id="mens1">Oral Contraceptives</h1>
<br>
<p id="para">Oral contraceptives (OCs), commonly called birth control pills or "the Pill," contain combinations of an estrogen and a progesterone (in a synthetic form called progestin).
<br><br>
  The estrogen compound used in most combination OCs is estradiol. There are many different progestins, but common types include levonorgestrel, drospirenone, and norgestrel. A four-phasic OC that contains estradiol and the progesterone dienogest, has been shown in small trials as effective for treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding.
  <br><br>
 <p id="para"><b>Side effects</b> 
  <br><br>
  Common side effects of combination OCs include headache, nausea, bloating, breast tenderness, and bleeding between periods. The estrogen component in combination OCs is usually responsible for these side effects. In general, today's OCs are much safer than OCs of the past because they contain much lower dosages of estrogen.
  <br><br>
  However, all OCs may increase the risk for migraine, stroke, heart attack, and blood clots. The risk is highest for women who smoke, who are over age 35, or who have a history of heart disease risk factors (such as high blood pressure or diabetes) or past cardiac events. Women who have certain metabolic disorders, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), are also at higher risk for the heart-related complications associated with these pills. Some types of combination OCs contain progestins, such as drospirenone, which have a higher risk for causing blood clots than levonorgestrel.</p>
